        <p>
         what about accounting?
         Accounting was my major and I have a master degree on that,
         I also passed the CPA exam, I thought I will become a CPA,
         but listened to my heart, no, I don`t want to be a CPA for my whole life,
         I want to work in the tech industry, and build something,
         be a part of change of people`s life. Did I learn something from accounting?
         Of course, paying attention to details, business logical mindset,

         People do not get it, why you have to change career
