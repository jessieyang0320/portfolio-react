        1. entrepreneur:   I consider myself a person with leadership and entrepreneur spirit.
        I started a company named MagiTech in 2015. Our goal is to change how people
        grow vegetables in China. Inspired by <a href="https://www.theaquaponicsource.com/what-is-aquaponics/">Aquaponic system</a>, me and my business partner
        redesigned a solar powered greenhouse, inside it, we utilized Aquaponic system to
        grow vegetables and keep fish, all these products are organic. Pro: organic,
        no fertilizer or pesticide, no pollution to water or soil  Con: hard to maintain,
        high cost. We got seed fund from Chinese local government and started our project
